    "# Building on Slack\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prerequisites: Complete Notebooks 1-3 and have your Slack App credentials ready. If you haven't set up your Slack App, follow the guide in the main README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous notebook, we built a webhook receiver to get real-time notifications from Manus. Now, we'll build on that foundation to create a bridge between Slack and Manus. This server will listen for events from Slack (like a user mentioning our bot) and translate them into tasks for Manus to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automations become truly useful when they react to real-world events as they happen. For many teams, the hub of activity is Slack—it's where support requests are flagged, bugs are reported, and ideas are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the crucial step before our final capstone project. We are building the \"front door\" for user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What You'll Learn in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connecting to the Slack API**: You'll validate your environment credentials and learn the fundamentals of Slack's event-driven architecture, including how to securely verify incoming requests.\n",
    "2. **Building a Slack Event Receiver**: We will deploy a server on Modal that can receive, validate, and process webhook events from Slack in real-time.\n",
    "3. **Creating a One-Way Workflow**: You will implement the core logic to automatically trigger a Manus task whenever your bot is @mentioned in a Slack channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a functional, one-way bot. You'll be able to mention it in a Slack channel, and behind the scenes, a Manus task will spring to life\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Our Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our server, it's crucial to confirm that our environment is correctly configured with all the necessary API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reminder: If you haven't set up your Slack App yet, please follow the Slack Setup guide in the main README.md to get your Bot Token and Signing Secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load our keys from the .env file into our notebook's environment. This cell will read the file and raise an error if any of the required keys are missing."

    "\n",
    "Now that we are successfully receiving events from Slack, it's time to process them. However, there's a critical rule when working with webhooks: Slack expects a response within three seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your server takes longer than that to reply, Slack will assume the request failed and will send the same event again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performing time-consuming actions directly in the webhook handler—like calling the Manus API to create a task—will almost certainly exceed this time limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can lead to duplicate requests and unreliable behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to process these requests asynchronously. Our server will perform two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acknowledge Immediately**: As soon as a request comes in, the webhook will immediately send a 200 OK response back to Slack to let it know the event was received successfully.\n",
    "2. **Process in the Background**: The actual work of parsing the message and creating a Manus task will be handed off to a background job that can run independently, without making Slack wait.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you moved beyond polling to build an efficient, event-driven solution for monitoring Manus tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Modal and FastAPI, you deployed a serverless webhook receiver that instantly processes task events. You learned to securely manage API credentials with Modal Secrets and fetch full conversation histories when tasks complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the journey so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Notebook 1: You created your first asynchronous task, learned to poll for its status, and managed a multi-turn conversation by continuing an existing task with new prompts.\n",
    "2. Notebook 2: You learned the three core methods for attaching files to your tasks: uploading local data directly, referencing public URLs, and embedding in-memory files using Base64 encoding.\n",
    "3. Notebook 3: You replaced inefficient polling with a professional, event-driven architecture by deploying a serverless webhook receiver with Modal and FastAPI, allowing your application to react instantly when a task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll tie everything together by building a Slack bot that  automatically extracts data from receipts, checks them against company policies in Notion, and updates a central expense database—all from a simple file upload in Slack."
