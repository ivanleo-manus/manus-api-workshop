    "> Prerequisites: Complete Notebooks 1-2 and have your MANUS_API_KEY configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous notebooks, we used polling to check the status of our tasks. While simple, this \"pull\" method of repeatedly asking \"Are you done yet?\" is inefficient and doesn't scale for real-world applications. It creates network noise, introduces delays, and wastes resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces webhooks, a powerful, event-driven \"push\" model. Instead of you asking for updates, Manus tells you the moment a task is complete by sending a notification directly to your application. This is the professional standard for building responsive, scalable, and efficient automations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we'll use two modern tools: FastAPI to create a simple and fast web server, and Modal to deploy it instantly to a live, public URL without any complex setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy a serverless webhook receiver using Modal and FastAPI.\n",
    "2. Process message_ended events to know exactly when a task is finished.\n",
    "3. Use the event payload to retrieve the full conversation history from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a production-ready foundation for event-driven automation, which will be the core of the intelligent support agent we will build in our final section."

    "## Why Webhooks Win at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"push\" model is where the server initiates communication. Instead of your application constantly asking for updates, the server pushes information to you the moment it becomes available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Webhooks use this model, giving you three major advantages for building professional applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantaneous Response : Your application is notified the moment an event occurs. This allows your workflows to react in real-time without any delays.\n",
    "2. Effeciency : Webhooks eliminate constant, repetitive API calls. This drastically reduces network traffic and saves server resources.\n",
    "3. Built for Scale : The webhook model handles a massive volume of events with minimal overhead. Your application can grow without a change in architecture."

    "To start, we'll create our webhook server. We'll use FastAPI to build the web application and Modal to serve it from a temporary, cloud-hosted environment. This gives us a public URL for testing without needing ngrok or a full deployment.\n",

    "    return {\"status\": \"received\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code does three key things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1, Defines a Modal Stub which describes our cloud application.\n",
    "2. Creates a standard FastAPI app with a /webhook endpoint that accepts POST requests.\n",
    "3. Attaches the FastAPI app to our Modal Stub, making it servable.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned how to move beyond the limitations of polling and create a more efficient, scalable solution for monitoring Manus tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Modal and FastAPI, you deployed a serverless webhook receiver that can instantly process task events from Manus. You learned how to securely manage API credentials with Modal Secrets and how to fetch the full conversation history and generated files when a task completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the journey so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Notebook 1, you mastered the fundamentals of creating and managing asynchronous tasks with the Manus API.\n",
    "2. In Notebook 2, you learned how to provide rich context to your tasks by attaching files, enabling far more complex and useful automations.\n",
    "3. And now, in this notebook, you've built the crucial event-driven layer that allows your applications to react instantly and efficiently, completing the core toolkit for building sophisticated workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll walk through how to build a simple slack bot that ties all of this together - allowing you to use the Manus Agent to proactively investigate support tickets before you even look at them, providing a rich amount of context before you look at them."
