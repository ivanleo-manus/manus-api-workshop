    "Over the last few notebooks, you've assembled a powerful toolkit for automation. You've mastered creating and managing asynchronous tasks, handling file uploads, building event-driven workflows with webhooks, and integrating it all into a conversational Slack bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to combine these skills to build a practical, end-to-end solution that solves a real-world business problem: automating employee vacation claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will create an intelligent support bot that lives in Slack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Employees will be able to submit their vacation expense claims by simply uploading a receipt and mentioning the bot. From there, our system will take over, using Manus to intelligently process the document and automatically add a structured entry into a central Notion database for the finance team to review.\n",
